<div>In high school I would have considered myself a pretty creative individual. I was in a visual arts program, and I frequently skipped out on those classes to practice with the music kids on the other side of campus. In the last decade I've become a full-time programmer and most of my creative muscles have "atrophied".</div>
  <p />
  <div>Recently, I've picked up an interest in game development and started experimenting with creating a <a href="https://github.com/ambethia/aposelene">2D game engine</a>. From there I started regaining interest in 3D modeling and animation again. When I was in my teens I spent a lot of time playing around with modeling in a now abandoned 3D package called <a href="http://www.izware.com/mirai/">Mirai</a> and rendering in ray tracers like <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a>. With Mirai in the wind, and most of the other "<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/">industry standard</a>" software just not appealing to me, I've decided to start learning <a href="http://www.luxology.com/modo/index.aspx">modo</a> as my main tool for 3D content creation. This will be my devlog as I start to re-explore the creative process&nbsp;in parallel with my game development efforts.</div>
