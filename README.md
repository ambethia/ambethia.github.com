This 2009 Update of my personal site. It's been a wordpress blog for the last
few years, but... well, I don't blog. I'm barely even capable of "micro
blogging" on Twitter.

But I still would I need a place to use for OpenID delegation and I can toss
in some github, delicious, flickr, etc.. widgets. The social web, woo.
